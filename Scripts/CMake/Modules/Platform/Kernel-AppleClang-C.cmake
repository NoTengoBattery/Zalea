MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "The Apple's version of Clang/LLVM is not supported by this project.\n"
        "In order to use Clang with this project, you will need to set up your environment variable 'PATH' to point "
        "to an official LLVM/Clang build (including a build from source) before any other path in your 'PATH'.\n"
        "See Apple's official help: "

        "Alternatively, you can set the CMake cache variable CMAKE_COMPILER_BIN_PATH to the path where the compiler "
        "is installed.\n"
        "See LLVM's releases web page to get a copy of Clang/LLVM: "
        "http://releases.llvm.org/download.html\n"
        "You will need to remove the CMake's cache after setting up your compiler and 'PATH' correctly, or before "
        "setting the CMAKE_COMPILER_BIN_PATH variable with the -D flag, in order to remove this error message.")
