#===----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------===#

# This macro will grab a target name in it's first argument, the visibility for the options, the linkage language and a
# variable (which is a list) and will disable all the requested "fancy features" for that target. This works by
# appending flags to the target which disables the previously enabled features. Not all features can be disabled and the
# exact flag is defined in the Platform files.
