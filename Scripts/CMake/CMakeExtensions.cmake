#/ Extensions for the CMake language. These extensions may be in "pure CMake" (because they come from a file that
#/ begins with "Pure") or they may use helper Python scripts.
#/
#/ These extensions provide an API which is intended to be permanent and reliable. This file will import extension
#/ scripts one by one. For new extensions to be added, you may have to add them to a extension script or create a new
#/ extension script and modify this file by hand.
