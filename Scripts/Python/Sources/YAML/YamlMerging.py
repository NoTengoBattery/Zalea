# / This file will generate a C source code file which contains a Hash Table, where the hash represents a string to a
# / property in a YAML object; and whose value is a pointer to the key-value pair of the property. This will implement a
# / kind of hash table, where the C program can calculate the hash of the property and use it as a index to the table
# / and get the pointer, and ultimately the value of the property's key.
