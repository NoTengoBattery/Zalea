# This is the compiler runtime, but not the "libgcc" (or "compiler-rt") part, it is the assumptions done by the
# optimizer about the standard library. For example, code that the compiler finds that is a `memcpy` will be optimized
# to a `memcpy` call. Therefore, we implement these functions here but provide them on the Non Standard C Library.

# This accessory library is the "libgcc" part. It does contains calls made by the compiler when the CPU or the platform
# does not support an operation (such as ARM not supporting integer division). It contains the sanitizers, the stack
# check protector and so on. It *does* require special compiler flags to disable fancy features (like avoiding to
# sanitize the sanitizer itself), and the backend support. Note that LTO will generate code that might change these
# flags.
#
# TODO: That means that for LTO, you will need to carefully enable or disable the features to ensure the minimum area
# TODO: where such features are disabled.
#
# TODO: For non-LTO, the code generated will be always generated without the flags and linked as-is, therefore, you will
# TODO: not have to disable these features in the software that use the non-LTO (raw machine code) compiled versions.
