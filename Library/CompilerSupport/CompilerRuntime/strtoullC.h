///
/// This function is a customized version. The standard-compatible versions can be used from the Non Standard C Library.
/// The main deference is that this function will take an struct pointer and use the provided struct to return the
/// result. This is because this function can convert an arbitrary string to an unsigned long long value with a sign,
/// which can be used to reinterpret the unsigned value as a signed value, and return it accordingly.
///
/// \note This implementation is inspired in the cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/strtol web page.
/// \note This implementation will not accept bases (radix) bigger than 36.
///
/// \param string a pointer to a C-like ASCII string which is to be interpreted.
/// \param endingPointer if not NULL, the pointer's value is changed to the address of the first invalid character.
/// \param base the base to use when performing the conversion.
/// \param result the struct that will be used to return the result of the conversion.
/// \param maximum the maximum value allowed for positive numbers (unsigned)
/// \param minimum the minimum value allowed for positive numbers (unsigned)
