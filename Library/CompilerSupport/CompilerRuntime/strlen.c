///
/// This is an implementation of the C standard function `strlen`. This function behaves exactly as the standard
/// version. It means that calling this function with a pointer that is not a string or is a string without null
/// character at the end, then the behaviour is undefined.
/// \param string is the null-terminated string to evaluate.
/// \return the size of the string, from the beginning to the null character without including it.
