/// This file tries to implement division of integer numbers. This is probably not fast at all but it's required by
/// targets that does not support integer division such as the ARM (some CPUs do support integer division but the
/// compiler will know). In theory, this code is an implementation of the large binary division.
///
/// This is probably the slowest possible implementation but anyway... it does work good.
