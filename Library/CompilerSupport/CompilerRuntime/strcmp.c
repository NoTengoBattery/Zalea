/// \brief Find whether a string is greater, smaller or equal to other string.
///
/// This is an implementation of the C standard function `strcmp`. This function behaves exactly as the standard
/// version. It means that calling this function with a pointer that is not a string or with a string without a null
/// character at the end will yield undefined behaviour.
///
/// \note This implementation is meant to be portable, not the fastest.
///
/// \param string1 the string that will be compared.
/// \param string2 the string to compare.
/// \return &lt;0 if the first character that does not match is lower, &#61;0 if both strings are equal and &gt;0 if the
/// first character that does not match is greater.
