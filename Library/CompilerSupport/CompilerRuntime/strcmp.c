///
/// This is an implementation of the C standard function `strcmp`. This function behaves exactly as the standard
/// version. It means that calling this function with a pointer that is not a string or is a string without null
/// character at the end, then the behaviour is undefined.
/// \param string1 the string that will be compared.
/// \param string2 the string to compare.
/// \return &lt;0 if the first character that does not match is lower, 0 if both strings are equal and >0 if the first
/// character that does not match is greater.
