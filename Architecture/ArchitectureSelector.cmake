#/ This file is used to select an architecture from the available ones. This is important because is the root of the
#/ whole configuration process. As from the architecture you can select your machine, compiler and only then you can
#/ configure the kernel features.
#/
#/ The other script is Machine Selector. This script selects the machine from the available machines and includes it's
#/ default config. This "default config" is populated to the cache before selecting the compiler.
