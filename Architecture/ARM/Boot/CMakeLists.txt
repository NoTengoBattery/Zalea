#/ This file will include the entry point for the Main Executable for ARM. The Main Executable contains all the code
#/ that will make the device fully functional.
#/
#/ TODO: In the future, we probably will compress the Main Executable image and append a "header" that will uncompress
#/ TODO: it, and put it in the VMA (by enabling the MMU).
