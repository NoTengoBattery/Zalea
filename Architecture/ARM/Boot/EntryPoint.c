///
/// This entry point is the secondary entry point for ARM. This is called directly from ASM, just after we have control
/// over the CPU. This will perform some testing and grab some information from the ARM ATAGS. However, since Linux had
/// deprecated the ATAGS, we cannot rely on it. We should get critical information from our implementation of the DTB
/// (not quite a DTB, just an equivalent).
/// \todo Add the required parameters from the bootloader to check them here.
