#/ Contains many variables exported to CMake describing the source tree structure. These variables are relative to the
#/ root CMakeLists.txt and shall be used whenever a reference to a in-source path is needed. The variables are, however
#/ a full path.
#/
#/ Variable names starts with TREE, following with the relative path to the folder they represent in snake case, all
#/ caps. They always end with '_PATH'.
#/
#/ In order to list a subfolder, the parent's path variable is used and not the raw path. Subfolders are listed in
#/ order after it's parent folder. This is for making refactoring easier: only track the folder's name and not the
#/ folder's path.
#/
#/ All variables in this script contains parts that are hardcoded! This is intentional: you can rely in these variables.
